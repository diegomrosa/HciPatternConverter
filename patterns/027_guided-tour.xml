<pattlet>Show users how to do it in several interactive steps
</pattlet>


<solution>A guided tour is a <pattern-link type="is-alternative" patternID="wizard"/>-type of thing. The thing that is to be learned is taught is several main steps that are listed so that the users can understand this. The users can select a step and read/see all about this step. To make the learning experience even stronger, users can interact in each step and 'perform' some actions that simulate real usage.
</solution>

<rationale>This is to closest thing to having somebody sit next to you and go through a complex thing.
