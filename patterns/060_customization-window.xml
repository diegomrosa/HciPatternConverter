<context>Websites that offer categorized content where users may be only interested in a handful of categories or items. This pattern is used when there is some form of customization available to the users. Often this is when it is a personal site such as a <pattern-link type="is-contained-by" patternID="my-site"/>. Typically users will need to do some form of <pattern-link type="not-related" patternID="login"/>.
</context>

<solution>Users are presented with areas that look like they are kind of windows. The have a "close" or "minimize" button next to an "edit" or "customize" button.
