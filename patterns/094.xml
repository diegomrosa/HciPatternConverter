<problem>Users need feedback that their action is being performed but may take a while to complete
</problem>


<context>You are designing a site where slow back-end systems are connected to. Some requests to the back-end system may take 5 to 30 seconds to complete and the users need some feedback telling them that their request is being performed and that they'll have to wait a bit. Only use this pattern when it is not possible to speed up the back-end processing time. Typically, a <pattern-link type="is-contained-by" patternID="travel-site"/> using this when flight-availability is being looked-up. It also occurs frequently in a <pattern-link type="is-contained-by" patternID="application"/>

<pattlet>Provide a feedback page with animation
</pattlet>


<solution>Provide information about the reason for the slow response so that users can have understanding of the problem. Also add an animation or real progress feedback so that users get a sense of continuity or progress.
</solution>

<rationale>Although it would be best to provide real progress feedback, this is often not technically possible in a web environment. Providing this type of feedback is the least that should be done for users who need to wait.
