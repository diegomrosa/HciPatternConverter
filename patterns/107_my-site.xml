<context>Typically used in a <pattern-link type="is-contained-by" patternID="portals"/>. Or in e-commerce sites where users have their own portions of the site.
</context>

<pattlet>Create a part of the site that belongs to a user and that is controlled by that user.
</pattlet>


<solution>First log in and then present a customized personal section. Usually the pages are built up using 'modules' that the users has selected. Each module is a <pattern-link type="contains" patternID="customization-window"/>. Users can change the which modules they want and in which layout and graphical presentation.
