<context>The number of topics is limited to 10. 
</context>

<pattlet>Create several sub-sites, one per topic, with one overall home-page
</pattlet>


<solution>What is the role of the home-page? How to design a home-page?
Navigating between portals. Horizontally showing the sub-sites followed by the logo and main sub-site navigation. Usually a 3 column layout.

From top to bottom:<br/>
1. sub-site navigation<br/>
2. logo<br/>
3. main navigation and main content<br/>
4. right column for contextual or shared stuff<br/>

The home-page's main function is to guide people to one of the sub-sites.
Use "preview blocks" that show what is going on in the specific sub-sites.
Usually the home-page also has a feature article and a list of headlines.
