<context>The site contains material that is copyrighted or keeps personal data of customers.

<pattlet>Add a footer bar with links to the conditions of use.
</pattlet>


<solution>The conditions of use may include a link to a copyright statement, disclaimers, privacy statements and other legal matters. The footer bar is also often combined with a <pattern-link type="contains"  patternID="repeated-menu"/> or other types of navigation that may come in handy. A footer bar is appropriate on any page of the site and should therefore become a standard element of all page templates.
