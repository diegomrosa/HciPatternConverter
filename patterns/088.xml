<name>Premium Content Lock</name>

<pattlet>Show previews of premium content and mark it visually
</pattlet>


<solution>Premium content and non-premium content are displayed together. In order to make clear which content can only be seen/obtained by registered users, a visual marking is placed near the premium content items. When such a marked item is clicked on the users are asked to register or login. After logging in the item is shown and no more markings appear.
<br/>
The usage of the 'lock' must be explained on the page, typically as part of a <pattern-link type="is-contained-by" patternID="footer-bar"/>.
</solution>

<rationale>Visual markings make it clear that there is something special about these item and the icon of a lock enforces the idea that they cannot access it directly. 
</rationale>

<example><img src="images/lock-ex2.gif" border="1"/><br/>
At CNN, a 'star' is used as a visual marking which is explained in the footer bar:<br/><img src="images/footer-ex1.gif" border="1"/>
