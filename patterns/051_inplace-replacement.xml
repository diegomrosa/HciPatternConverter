<problem>Users need to see a bit more details on an item in a large list
</problem>


<context>Variation in using popups or <pattern-link type="is-alternative" patternID="overview-detail"/>. Only use when the amount of additional details that need to be shown is limited, typically 3-5 lines of text.

<pattlet>When selecting an item, create more space for the item and display additional details
</pattlet>


<solution>Basically, other items are moved down and the created space is used to give a bit more detail about the selected item. By clicking on the item 'header' again, or by clicking on a different item, the space is reduced to normal again. It is important that the display of the additional information is 'instantly' so that it feels like a mouse-over. So don't use a page refresh to create this effect.
</solution>

<rationale>When users just need a bit more information on the item, this type of interaction feels much better than opening a new screen with the details and then having to navigate back to the overview. An <pattern-link type="is-alternative" patternID="overview-detail"/> requires a separate fixed space for the details which may not always be possible in the page design. This method hardly consumes extra space while it still greatly improves the experience.
